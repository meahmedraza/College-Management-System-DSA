# College Management System (DSA Project)

## 📖 Introduction
The **College Management System** is designed to manage and automate essential academic and administrative tasks of an educational institute.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts to handle data efficiently.  

It allows:
- Admins to manage records of students, teachers, and staff.  
- Teachers to update results, attendance, and personal details.  
- Students to view results, fee details, timetable, academic calendar, and print roll number slips.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a digital management solution for college administration.  
- Reduce time spent on manual record handling.  
- Ensure accuracy, consistency, and quick access to information.  
- Support students, teachers, and administrators with role-specific functionality.
