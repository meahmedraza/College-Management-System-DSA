# 📚 College Management System (DSA Project)

A **console-based College Management System** implemented in **C++** using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.  
This project simulates basic operations for students, teachers, and administrators in a university/college environment.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 👨‍🎓 **Student Management**
  - Add, update, search, and delete student records.
  - Store and retrieve marks/grades.
  - Maintain student login functionality.

- 👨‍🏫 **Teacher Management**
  - Manage teacher records (add, update, delete).
  - Assign courses and track attendance.
  - Teacher-specific login system.

- 🏫 **Admin Panel**
  - Admin authentication with logs.
  - Manage all users (students/teachers).
  - Access reports and system logs.

- 📑 **File Handling**
  - Data stored in `.txt` files (`student.txt`, `teacher.txt`, `Marks.txt`, `Admin_logs.txt`).
  - Persistent storage across multiple runs.
